    <h1>ABOUT PHP:-</h1>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPDB7ZKK/download.png" alt="image">
    <p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development.It was originally created by
        Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The
        PHP Group.PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism
        PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>

    <p>code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a
        Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code
        – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of
        an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which
        can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for
        many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone
        control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.</p>
